# ee541_hw5
code for ee541_hw
Data file contains those hanlded_data for compatiability test
model_best contains the best Resnet model parameters.
Compatiability file contains the trained my_model parameters.


BTW, I reaaly suggest professor give the target label for test_pairwise_compat_hw.txt since it's so hard to get their label from billions
combinations of compatiability data. Just make life easier plz!
